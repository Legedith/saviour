There were three main problems we faced when we started with programming: 

First: We didn't have an active internet connection and since all the coding challenge websites like hackerank and codewars worked only with an internet connection, it was particularly difficult to practice our skills. 

Second: We had to search stackOverflow and other platforms to find solutions for programming problems. But, a lot of times the code would not be explained properly and we had a hard time figuring out what it did.

Third: We didn't knew how to style our code properly or what styling practies to follow. 

So for this hackathon, we created a python package that helps us with all these issues. Introducing Saviour.

It has three main components, you can view a list of commands by running saviour-help.

Let's try styling our code first:
As you can see, here's a file with pretty bad styling. 
Let's run saviour-style samplecode.py

As you can see from the output, the code is styled according to pep8 standard now.

Due to lack of comments in this file, I can't understand what this code does. 
Let's use the saviour-pseudocode command to understand the code.
* runs the command *
As you can see, it was calculating the sum of n natural numbers.

Now let's say I want to practice my coding skills but don't have an internet connection. 
I can run saviour-practice and it'll give me a programming challenge.

I happen to have solved this one already, let's check my answer.
* runs saviour-check and inputs a wrong answer*
Looks like I messed up a digit
* enters the correct answer this time *
Aha, as you can see, I got the answer right.
