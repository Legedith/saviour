Description: # SAVIOUR
        
        ## Inspiration
        
        There were three main problems we faced when we started with programming: 
        
        First: We didn't have an active internet connection and since all the coding challenge websites like Hackerank and CodeWars worked only with an internet connection, it was particularly difficult to practice our skills. 
        
        Second: We had to search StackOverflow and other platforms to find solutions for programming problems. But, a lot of times the code would not be explained properly and we had a hard time figuring out what it did. Also sometimes we'd write code without properly documenting it or adding comments and then later wonder how it worked.
        
        Third: We didn't knew how to style our code properly or what styling practices to follow. 
        
        We created a python package that helps us with all these issues aka our Saviour.
        
        ## What it does
        It has three main components, you can view a list of commands by running saviour-help. They are 
        <ul>
        <li>Saviour-style -> Use for code styling using pep8 standards</li>
        <li>Savior-pseudocode -> Use for generating pseudocode from a program</li>
        <li>Savior-practice -> Use for practicing programming questions offline</li>
        </ul>
