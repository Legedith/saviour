Instead they proceed directly to jail.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.\n\nCommunity Chest (2/16 cards):\nAdvance to GO\nGo to JAIL\nChance (10/16 cards):\nAdvance to GO\nGo to JAIL\nGo to C1\nGo to E3\nGo to H2\nGo to R1\nGo to next R (railway company)\nGo to next R\nGo to next U (utility company)\nGo back 3 squares.\n\nThe heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square.

For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in.

For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.\n\nPerhaps less well known are longer chains.
